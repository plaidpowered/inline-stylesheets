# Inline Stylesheets

Would you like all your page stylesheets to get dumped inside a `<style>` tag within your website `<head>`? This plugin for WordPress may be exactly what you're looking for!

Literally that's all it does. No configuration, just a little bit of URL rewriting to account for absolute/relative paths, cleans out comments, and then pure output. Every server-side stylesheet that has been enqueued properly will be dumped.

Uglify the stylesheet, because why not?
